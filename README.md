###Olympus
This is a little project I've undertaken to replicate and advance SBSettings' functionality, with a a prettier UI, thanks to iOS 6. Standard toggles are on the way, I shall create an API to allow third-party toggles to be created too. For now, this is not created with the iPad in mind (hello, no JB!). I will work on it once I the jailbreak is released, but is _not_ a priority.

The ETA for this tweak is sometime in sync with the release of the iOS 6 JB (since now there's only three devices that can use it for now (iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, iPhone 3GS)).

In the mean time, I would appreciate all the help I can get, so if you think you can help in the slightest, don't hesitate to fork this repo and create pull requests.
